;; Data Structures

;; When the algorithm terminates, all remaining related-pairs <i, s> have the property that the
;; abstract implementation state i (abstractly) conforms to the abstract specification state s.
;;
;; These pairs are vertices of a dependency graph that constitutes a proof that all members of the
;; graph are in the conformance relation. Earlier in the algorithm, the graph is unsound, and the
;; algorithm uses a coinductive technique to remove the "local lies" and propagate the conseequences
;; of retracting these nodes, until we reach a sound fixpoint.
;;
;; We use this general technique for multiple relations, each of which is a subset of the previous
;; one, eventually leading to the spec conformance relation.
(struct related-pair (impl-config spec-config) #:transparent)

;; A possible transition step of an implementation configuration, representing the computation of a
;; single message/timeout handler. Fields are as follows:
;;
;; trigger: A representation of the message-receive or timeout that kicked off this
;; computation. Exact representation matches the trigger# form in csa#.
;;
;; from-observer?: A boolean indicating whether the trigger was caused by the "observer" portion of
;; the environment, as described in the conformance semantics. Can be true only for steps with
;; external-receive triggers.
;;
;; outputs: A list of abstract address/abstract value pairs indicating the messages sent to the
;; environment during the computation.
;;
;; dest-config: The implementation configuration reached at the end of this transition step
(struct impl-step (trigger from-observer? outputs dest-config) #:transparent)

;; A possible (weak) transition step of a specification configuration, representing the actions taken
;; to match some (handler-level) implementation transition step. Weak transitions correspond to the
;; general idea of weak simulations; see the dissertation for details. Fields are as follows:
;;
;; dest-config: The specification configuration reached at the end of the weak transition.
;;
;; spawned-specs: The set of specification configurations forked off by this transition
;; step. A conforming implementation configuration must conform to all of these configs in
;; addition to dest-config.

;; Constants

;; The maximum number of times to unfold a recursive type while generating an exhaustive set of
;; abstract values for that type.
;;
;; This number is an arbitrary choice for now. Later it may make sense to base it off of the level of
;; detail in the spec or program.

;; Top-level Algorithm

;; Given a concrete implementation configuration, a concrete specification configuration, returns #t
;; if the conformance-check algorithm can prove that the implementation conforms to the specification,
;; #f otherwise.
;;
;; The algorithm works by abstracting the given initial configurations into abstract configurations,
;; then constructing a graph-like structure that acts as a constructive proof of conformance for the
;; abstract pair (roughly, every vertex (pair of configurations) in the graph is in the conformance
;; relation, and every edge points to the pair that supports some necessary dependency of the source
;; pair. By the soundness theorem for abstract conformance, if conformance holds for the abstract
;; pairs (i.e. the pairs are in the graph), then it holds for the original concrete pairs, as well.
;;
;; To construct this structure, the algorithm first abstractly interprets the implementation and
;; specification to find configuration pairs in which the specification can simulate the
;; implementation up to one step (see find-rank1-simulation). This process also uncovers all edges and
;; vertices that related pairs would rely upon to be part of a full simulation relation. By removing
;; those pairs from our proof graph and propagating the results of those removals backwards until we
;; reach a greatest fixpoint (see remove-unsupported), we end up with a proof graph whose vertices are
;; all configuration pairs in the simulation.
;;
;; Next, we identify the the vertices in the graph whose implementation configurations are not
;; guaranteed to satisfy all of their commitments in every fair execution (see find-unsatisfying-pairs
;; below). By removing these nodes and again back-propagating the effects of those removals (with
;; remove-unsupported again), the resulting graph represents a proof that all of its members are in
;; the conformance relation.
