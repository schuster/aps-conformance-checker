Remaining big challenges I see in the analysis:
* how to verify output commitments that are satisfied in a different handler than they were incurred (esp. if commitment is delegated to another actor, e.g. the session child in the TCP example)
* how to verify multi-actor programs (no clue on this one yet - need more good examples) (disjoint lemma can help, but won't always be possible)
* how to verify outputs when there's ambiguity as to which send matches which commitment
* how to verify cases where the transmission match is ambiguous (need constraint solver instead of BFS?)
